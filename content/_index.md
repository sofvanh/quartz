title: "Sofia's Digital Garden"

Hello beautiful, and welcome to my [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]].
It's not quite a regular website, not quite a blog - it's my personal digital plot of land that I aim to cultivate to make wonderful things bloom and to let others enjoy the products of my mind and life.

This garden is a very early work in progress.
It will be populated as I make notes on new things and as I turn old notes into ones fit for the public.
Recently I've been writing about [[notes/Inadequacy|the feeling of inadequacy]] and learning [[notes/Why aligning AI matters|why 'aligning' artificial intelligence matters]].

If you'd like, you can [preorder my newsletter](https://forms.gle/3hrdwCcSb6eMSG5AA).
I may or may not actually start sending things.
