title: Sofia's Digital Garden
---

Hello beautiful, and welcome to my [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]].
It's not quite a regular website, not quite a blog - it's my personal digital plot of land that I aim to cultivate to make wonderful things bloom and to let others enjoy the products of my mind and life.

This garden is a very early work in progress.
It will be populated as I make notes on new things and as I turn old notes into ones fit for the public.
Recently I've been writing about [[notes/Inadequacy|the feeling of inadequacy]] and learning [[notes/Why AGI alignment matters|why aligning AI matters]].
