title: "Sofia's Digital Garden"
---

**Hello beautiful, and welcome to my [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]].**
It's not quite a regular website, not quite a blog - it's my personal digital plot of land that I aim to cultivate to make wonderful things bloom and to let others enjoy the products of my mind and life.
It's also an **early work-in-progress**, so please tread gently ðŸ’›

To explore a digital garden, all you need to do is meander.
Click on things that seem interesting.
Below are some places you could start; There's also a search bar, in case you're looking for something in particular.

Thank you for visiting; I appreciate you. âœ¨
