Hello beautiful, and welcome to my [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]].
It's not quite a regular website, not quite a blog - it's my personal digital plot of land that I aim to cultivate to make wonderful things bloom and to let others enjoy the products of my mind and life.
It's also an **early work-in-progress**, so please tread gently ðŸ’›

Recent thinking:
- [[notes/Inadequacy|Inadequacy]]
- [[notes/Why aligning AI matters|Why 'aligning' artificial intelligence matters]]
- [[notes/How to|How to x]]
- [[notes/Becoming an artist is easier than you think|Becoming an artist is easier than you think]]

Coming soon:
- Guides on holistic health
- Spirituality (Kashmiri Shaivism)
- Proper learning notes on everything I'm learning (first thing, neural nets!)
- Art

If you'd like, you can [preorder my newsletter](https://forms.gle/3hrdwCcSb6eMSG5AA).
I may or may not actually start sending things.

Thank you for visiting; I appreciate you. âœ¨
