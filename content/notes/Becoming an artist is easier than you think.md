*ðŸŒ± Seed. Early version of an essay.*

My time is split between hard sciences and art of all kinds.
I'm a computer science major, software engineer, tech lead, whatever - and in my spare time I sing, play multiple instruments, draw and paint and do calligraphy, act in improv groups and musicals, dance in blues and fusion parties, write prose and poetry, and design knits and interiors.
In the past, I've done pottery, digital art, and ballet, to name a few.

One of my life goals, besides spreading love and having massive positive impact through my career, is to create art.
So far I'd say I'm on track!

People are often surprised to hear that I'm skilled in all these activities (by the loosest possible definition of "skilled.")
Sometimes I get asked how one should start learning one of these skills - playing the piano, for example.
I've been trying to come up with an answer to this question for some time, and here's my current proposal: **Just start playing around with the medium.**

That's how I started with my first artistic hobby: Apparently, I began singing before I started talking.
I've heard stories of how my mother would push me in a stroller down the street and I would be "singing" loudly, for all the world to hear.
While I can't personally confirm this story, I do remember learning to play the piano in this way: I was five years old when, during a family trip, I came across a piano and just started pressing the keys.
Apparently that, and my following excitement over the instrument, convinced my parents to buy a piano.

I remember spending endless hours experimenting, coming up with tunes, and especially copying things I'd heard on the radio.
I had some formal training so I learned my theory, but I almost never did my homework, and I would get tired of every teacher within a year.
Therefore most of my "practice" came not from guidance but from independent experimentation.
(The only teachers I never tired of were the two teaching me the trumpet and the harp.
Miia and Pauliina, thank you for never losing your cool after I'd skipped homework!)

As I've gotten interested in other mediums, I've tried different approaches.
Many times I've looked for books or online courses to get me "properly good" at something.
What I've found is that if I can finish the program in one night, I'll get it done; Otherwise I'll lose motivation and momentum, feel bad, and give up on the medium completely for some time.
(I had this happen several times with drawing.
I find programs like [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com) completely antithetical to how one should learn art.)

You can see this go even worse with music, particularly with children who learn primarily with a teacher.
I have plenty of friends who learned to play technically impressive pieces as children, and now as adults, they despise the very instrument they spent all that time and effort on.
The skill is now giving them zero benefits, and they might even be left with mild trauma.

Learning of art, when it's programmed, is **not fun**.
And when you're not having fun, you're both worse at learning and less creative.

What has worked for me is to just **do what I enjoy.**
For example, when I'm inspired to become better on the piano, I will do whatever I feel like: I might improvise in my old style, or I might try to learn one of Chopin's Nocturnes from sheet music, or I might even google "basic jazz chords on piano" and try to make nice sounds with that new knowledge.
The point is that I only do it as long as I'm enjoying myself (I have yet to learn a full Nocturne) and I don't feel bad about going to do something else once I've had my fill of playing.

I use the same approach with all my other artistic endeavors, and the results have been wonderful:
Since ditching structured programs, I have been learning new mediums faster than ever before, while enjoying myself 100% of the time.
Discipline is not the only way to learn to create art.
In my opinion, the more you lean on joy and inspiration over discipline, the better off you will be.

*(But that's just me. If you have thoughts on this topic, I'd love to hear them!)*

#### Notes
- (Does this whole write-up come off as self-indulgent?)
- Things I'd like to add
	- Empirical proof on "generalists" with no formal training being better musicians (my friend Aleksi, and that guy mentioned in Range (the book))
	- More thoughts on how to learn the "technical skills" of a medium
		- There is probably a difference between musical instruments vs visual art vs dance
			- Learning ballet without a course seems very hard; Learning to draw, or sing, with minor instruction in technique, seems totally doable
		- I guess one benefits quite a lot from single lessons in a medium when first starting
			- This is how I learned calligraphy
	- Consider a new note on the pros and cons of learning music theory
	- I'd like to link to things I've created, to serve as proof that I actually have developed skills, but also to serve as inspiration
