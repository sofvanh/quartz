*ðŸŒ± Seed. Thoughts on how to leverage the mysterious, almost magic-like power of the subconscious, most often through intention-setting and "manifesting."*

> **Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.**

### How-to
- Spend a lot of time thinking about what you want, at regular intervals. Put aside down to do writing on what you want your life to look like in the near and far future. Fantasise about different possible futures. 
- Be open to possibilities and opportunities. Listen and learn from people who seem "magical", where you don't understand how they achieved what they have.
- Put gentle nudges in your environment, like a quote in on your wall, or phone wallpaper, or daily notes, guiding you to the direction you want to get to. Actually, just take full ownership of your environment, surrounding yourself as much as possible with the people, ideas, and concepts you want to orient towards.
