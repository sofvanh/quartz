*ðŸŒ± Seed. Work-in-progress note where I try to get closer to my goal of experiencing writing and note-taking as part of my spiritual practice.*

My goal is for my entire life to be based on spirituality, and for each moment to be a reflection of that. I tend to spend a lot of time writing, and so it makes sense to be deliberate about turning the act of writing into something spiritual.

- Can I write for other people, or for my public notes, and have it be spiritual? How much can I allow other people to pervade my practice? Or should I make engaging with people, as with the universe as a whole, a part of my practice? (The answer is probably yes. What will that look like?)
- When I write on paper, in Finnish, in the middle of the night under candlelight about my feelings and hopes and dreams, that clearly feels spiritual. I'm tapping into my subconscious, I'm engaging with the powers that are bigger than my conscious mind, and I'm doing work for the betterment of this body-mind that will end up radiating health and love to the universe.
	- How can I have this same effect when writing on the computer? Or when writing notes while studying?
- It seems that when writing is not authenthic, it cannot be spiritual. How authenthic can my public notes become? At what point will I cross the line of over-sharing?
	- There's a clear energy towards self-censorship when I know I'm writing something I would like to publish. Can this process be spiritual?
		- This seems interesting to explore. What is self-censorship? Does it arise out of fear or sensible social dynamics? Does it serve a purpose in digital gardening, when the whole point is that you can make your garden look like you?
			- What am I actually comfortable sharing with the world? Can bad things happen to me if *literally anyone* can read my thoughts?

I'm generally uncomfortable with sharing things in public. I barely exist on social media, and I even avoid big discussion channels when I can. It's clearly easier to be spiritual when you're not connected to society, but completely disconnecting from society is orthogonal to my spiritual goals.

I guess there should be some kind of compromise or gentle landing that I can perform into the wilderness of the internet. Or maybe I just need to be mindful of it. Or maybe I need to recruit my friends to proofread my thoughts for a bit, to make sure I don't accidentally "do something bad" - but I don't want to do that! I don't want oversight. I just want to do my thing. The problem is, I don't know how *safe* it is to do my thing like this, in public.

I just can't shake the feeling that it's *so weird* to write something, and then put it online. Once it's out there, it's out there - people are going to make their own interpretations of that writing, and of me, too. Suddenly the text has its own life, it's no longer just mine.

Maybe this is just me learning to have more flexible boundaries. Or, maybe I'm learning to be more generous with my thinking? I'm used to having my world and thoughts all for myself, and I've gotten comfortable in "owning" all of it. Perhaps I've come to identify with it even.

Is my thinking no longer mine if I put it online? Once other people make their interpretations, does that stain the purity of my thoughts? Does the experience of the collective override the individual experience?

Let's take a tantric, non-dual view. Let's assume that the individual is the collective; That is, the boundary between "I" and "them" is illusory. Let's assume "spirituality" is actually just the act of engaging with what is, with the divine existence.

From this perspective, the act of publishing thought online is simply an act of sharing divine self-expression with the larger divine. It's an act of increasing abundance, an act of generosity, connection, engaging, authenthicity. Any bad that could come out of it would only be a symptom of pain, and as long as the writing comes from a place of health and authenthicity, the writing has much larger potential to heal than it does to harm.

If we take this stance, then it actually becomes my *duty* to publish online. Not doing so would be selfish.

Ok, I think I like that framing. **Sharing my writing online is a divine act of self-expression and generosity, and it is likely to lead to abundance and healing over anything else.**

We'll see if it sticks.
