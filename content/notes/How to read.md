*ðŸŒ± Seed. Contemplation on how I want to read.*

**Nonfiction:** Learn to skim, connect what you're reading with what you already know, ask questions, make notes of what you will actually want to come back to. (I basically make cheat sheets of lists and processes. Sometimes I write down quotes.)

**Fiction:** Read slow enough to enjoy it but fast enough to experience the whole story, without forgetting the context between sessions. Read in bed for fabulous sleep. Only read books that nourish your soul.
