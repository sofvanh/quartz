# How to read

**Nonfiction:** Learn to skim, connect what you're reading with what you already know, ask questions, make notes of what you will actually want to come back to. (I basically make cheat sheets of lists and processes. Sometimes I write down quotes.)

**Fiction:** Read slow enough to enjoy it but fast enough to experience the whole story, without forgetting the context between sessions. Read in bed for fabulous sleep. Only read books that nourish your soul.

# How to learn

Write down unfamiliar concepts. Create a map of connections, rather than a linear story. Use visual tools. Connect everything to everything.

# How to be online

Surround yourself with what you aspire to become. Get off social media, unless it's nourishing. Explore intentionally. Start a [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]]. **Create art, not content.**

Open question: What's a good heuristic for deciding if something should be published online or not?

# How to create

[[notes/Becoming an artist is easier than you think|Become an artist in your everyday life.]] Also, just do. Set intentions. Imagine who you want to be, what you want to be five, ten, fifty years from now. Then act accordingly.

> Inspiration is perishable; Act on it immediately.
