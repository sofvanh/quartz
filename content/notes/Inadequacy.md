"I am completely inept and inadequate at all the things I'm trying to do."

That's a thought I had a few days ago.

People call me a perfectionist, and I tend to shrug it off.
I don't really see it.
I don't feel it.
I suppose that's because "perfectionism" is not a feeling.
Inadequacy is, though.

I spend most of my time feeling pretty good about myself.
I've worked a lot on my self-image, and I rather like this body-mind that I get to prance around as.
Whenever I do get hit by a crippling sense of inadequacy, it tends to shake me up quite a bit.
I suppose sometimes it can be a useful signal, but let's be real, most of the time it's bullshit.

The voice in your head saying you're not good enough is redundant and irrational and impossible to make quiet by force.
It's also so completely dualistic, and therefore opposite to my spiritual path, that I end up feeling bad and a little confused about how this voice still manages to hold such a strong position in my head.
I know I am good enough, I know we are all good enough, I know comparison of this kind is redundant.

I don't often feel inadequate, but when I do, it's easy for me to go down into a downward spiral.
I feel inadequate about feeling inadequate.
Further, thanks to confirmation bias, in this state I tend to notice subtle "evidence" of my inadequacy, making the situation worse.

I could write about how the solution to this feeling could be human connection.
In a way it's true - realizing that other people feel inadequate just like you do can be helpful.
Yet I don't think that's the right way.
You see, I don't want to solve the feeling after it arises - I want to not feel it in the first place.
I want to identify the root of my feeling of inadequacy, analyze it, and nurture it back to health. 
I will find the wound that is bleeding out this emotion and help it heal. ðŸ’›
