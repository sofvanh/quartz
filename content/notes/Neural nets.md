[Detailed mind map in Heptabase](https://app.heptabase.com/w/6079eefb857fc088ac36275c3d17f1fddf257924962506367e8f79289c6dccf8)

I'm learning about neural nets, and creating a detailed Heptabase map on the topic. So far I've been really happy with this approach - I'm getting a very in-depth and concrete understanding, the process of learning feels intuitive and motivating, and the map is raising interesting conversations in the boot camp I'm participating in. A common comment I get is "this is different from how I think about it" which seems to result in a more robust understanding for the person studying the map.
