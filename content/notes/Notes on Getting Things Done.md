## Five steps in the GTD process
1. Capture your thoughts in external collection tools that you routinely empty. This frees up your mind to do what it's really good at: thinking and solving problems.  
2. Clarify what each item is and what you can do with it.  
3. Organize the outcomes into a structure of lists, like your Calendar and your Projects, Next Actions, Someday/Maybe and Waiting For lists.  
4. Reflect on what is important to you and review the items in your system. This is crucial because it ensures that you continue to trust the system.  
5. Engage your tasks. Pick which action you can do something about given the context, time and energy available, as well as your priorities.
