Get this:
The first thought I have as I start writing a note about authenthicity is "I need to try to make this good because people might read it and judge me based on it."
What a great illustration of the point I'm about to make.

I'm pretty confident that much of modern western suffering is caused by inauthenthicity.
I mean people living with masks, consciously and unconsciously.
People not being in touch with their values, needs, and emotions;
People not accepting their true selves, and certainly not expressing it.

Authenthicity entered my framework of values around the summer of 2021.
Since I started working with this value, I've become much lighter.
The concept is pretty crucially connected to control:
When you're carrying a big mask around, you're essentially trying to control how others view you

I realize this all kind of breaks down when your "true self", or your true state of being, is one that's not generally accepted.
I acknowledge my privilege in being a neurotypical white straight woman who's generally able to do what she feels like without facing scorn from society.
