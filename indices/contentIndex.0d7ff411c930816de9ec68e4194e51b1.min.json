{"/":{"title":"Sofia's Digital Garden","content":"\nHello beautiful, and welcome to my [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]]. It's not quite a regular website, not quite a blog - it's my personal digital plot of land that I aim to cultivate to make wonderful things bloom and to let others enjoy the products of my mind and life.\n\nContent coming soon - meanwhile, here's a photo I recently took while visiting Victoria, BC âœ¨\n\n![[photos/BC.jpg]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T22:39:33.632966015Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digital-gardens":{"title":"Digital gardens","content":"\n# Digital gardens\n\nI recently came across a bunch of websites doing something incredibly interesting: \nPeople are sharing their personal notes (often Obsidian vaults), or a curated collection of them, publicly on the internet, on their own websites.\nSome describe these websites as \"digital gardens\". \nThere's a few ways this metaphor can work:\n\n- Thoughts (=seeds) can blossom into fully-fledged ideas (=fruit) when they are nurtured in the form of writing, sharing, and discussing\n- Traversing through a network of someone's personal notes can feel just as intimate and inspiring as exploring the garden that's carefully and lovingly tended by a unique and creative gardener\n- When many different people come together, the result is a kind of community garden, where everyone contributes according to their unique strengths and interests, one's ideas inspire the process of another's, things are discussed out in the open, and everyone gets to enjoy the benefits\n\nI've been having a wonderful time enjoying the notes of people: \nI'm learning about concepts and ideas that I've never before come across, and I'm finding incredibly specific and useful guides to all sorts of problems. \nFurther, as someone who's long been obsessed with gaining perspectives, exploring someone's digital garden feels so much like actually stepping into their brain that to me it's almost addictive.\n\n## My approach\n\nI've long been planning to start a blog, yet the idea is more intimidating than the idea of starting a digital garden. \nThe issue has something to do with how a blog is about showing off finished work, about proving something, while a digital garden is all about sharing the work-in-progress and learning in public - it's about giving, sharing, and nurturing, it's much more personal and private and accepting of mistakes and growth, while something like a blog or social media is more about showing, proving, gaining.\n\nIt seems like the future of the internet is in the direction of collaborative thinking and authentic sharing (or at least that's my dream) and I believe more people should start sharing their personal notes on things they have unique insight and knowledge on.\n\nI'm happy to be exploring this option for self-expression in a way that will help me:\n- Become a better writer\n- Share my thoughts, ideas, learnings, art, and perspective with the world\n- Connect with people who share my interests and want to collaborate in creating a wonderful future\n\n## Resources\n\nList of the inspiring digital gardens I've found so far, in no particular order:\n- [Jacky Zhao's website](https://jzhao.xyz)\n- [Nicole van der Hoeven's public notes](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain)\n- [Chloe Abrasada's digital garden](https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/)\n- [Bianca Aguilar's digital garden](https://garden.bianca.digital/)\n- [Joel Hooks' digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)\n- More in [showcased digital gardens on Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/)\n\nIf you want to start your own digital garden, and are already using Obsidian (or have Markdown files ready to go) you should check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).","lastmodified":"2022-08-03T22:39:33.632966015Z","tags":null}}
