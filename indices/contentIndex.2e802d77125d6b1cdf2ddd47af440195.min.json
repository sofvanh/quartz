Otherwise I'll lose motivation and momentum, feel bad, and give up on the medium completely for some time.\n(I had this happen several times with drawing.\nI find programs like [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com) completely antithetical to how one should learn art.)\n\nYou can see this go even worse with music, particularly with children who learn primarily with a teacher.\nI have plenty of friends who learned to play technically impressive pieces as children, and now as adults, they despise the very instrument they spent all that time and effort on.\nThe skill is now giving them zero benefits, and they might even be left with mild trauma.\n\nLearning of art, when it's programmed, is **not fun**.\nAnd when you're not having fun, you're both worse at learning and less creative.\n\nWhat has worked for me is to just **do what I enjoy.**\nFor example, when I'm inspired to become better on the piano, I will do whatever I feel like: I might improvise in my old style, or I might try to learn one of Chopin's Nocturnes from sheet music, or I might even google \"basic jazz chords on piano\" and try to make nice sounds with that new knowledge.\nThe point is that I only do it as long as I'm enjoying myself (I have yet to learn a full Nocturne) and I don't feel bad about going to do something else once I've had my fill of playing.\n\nI use the same approach with all my other artistic endeavors, and the results have been wonderful:\nSince ditching structured programs, I have been learning new mediums faster than ever before, while enjoying myself 100% of the time.\nDiscipline is not the only way to learn to create art.\nIn my opinion, the more you lean on joy and inspiration over discipline, the better off you will be.\n\n*(But that's just me. If you have thoughts on this topic, I'd love to hear them!)*\n\n---\n\n#### Notes\n- (Does this whole write-up come off as self-indulgent?)\n- Things I'd like to add\n\t- Empirical proof on \"generalists\" with no formal training being better musicians (my friend Aleksi, and that guy mentioned in Range (the book))\n\t- More thoughts on how to learn the \"technical skills\" of a medium\n\t\t- There is probably a difference between musical instruments vs visual art vs dance\n\t\t\t- Learning ballet without a course seems very hard; Learning to draw, or sing, with minor instruction in technique, seems totally doable\n\t\t- I guess one benefits quite a lot from single lessons in a medium when first starting\n\t\t\t- This is how I learned calligraphy\n\t- Consider a new note on the pros and cons of learning music theory\n\t- I'd like to link to things I've created, to serve as proof that I actually have developed skills, but also to serve as inspiration","lastmodified":"2022-08-21T19:01:42.227213874Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digital-gardens":{"title":"Digital gardens","content":"\nI recently came across a bunch of websites doing something interesting: \nPeople are sharing their personal notes (often Obsidian vaults), or a curated collection of them, publicly on the internet, on their own websites.\nSome describe these websites as \"digital gardens\". \nThere's a few ways this metaphor can work:\n\n- Thoughts (=seeds) can blossom into fully-fledged ideas (=fruit) when they are nurtured in the form of writing, sharing, and discussing\n- Traversing through a network of someone's personal notes can feel just as intimate and inspiring as exploring the garden that's carefully and lovingly tended by a unique and creative gardener\n- When many different people come together, the result is a kind of community garden, where everyone contributes according to their unique strengths and interests, one's ideas inspire the process of another's, things are discussed out in the open, and everyone gets to enjoy the benefits\n\nI've been having a wonderful time enjoying the notes of people: \nI'm learning about concepts and ideas that I've never before come across, and I'm finding incredibly specific and useful guides to all sorts of problems. \nFurther, as someone who's long been obsessed with gaining perspectives, exploring someone's digital garden feels so much like actually stepping into their brain that to me it's almost addictive.\n\n### My approach\n\nI've long been planning to start a blog, yet the idea is more intimidating than the idea of starting a digital garden. \nThe issue has something to do with how a blog is about showing off finished work, about proving something, while a digital garden is all about sharing the work-in-progress and learning in public - it's about giving, sharing, and nurturing, it's much more personal and private and accepting of mistakes and growth, while something like a blog or social media is more about showing, proving, gaining.\n\nIt seems like the future of the internet is in the direction of collaborative thinking and authentic sharing (or at least that's my dream) and I believe more people should start sharing their personal notes on things they have unique insight and knowledge on.\n\nI'm happy to be exploring this option for self-expression in a way that will help me:\n- Become a better writer\n- Share my thoughts, ideas, learnings, art, and perspective with the world\n- Connect with people who share my interests and want to collaborate in creating a wonderful future\n\n### Resources\n\nList of the inspiring digital gardens I've found so far, in no particular order:\n- [Nicole van der Hoeven's public notes](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain)\n- [Maggie Appleton's tweeted list](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880)\n- [Jacky Zhao's website](https://jzhao.xyz)\n- [Chloe Abrasada's digital garden](https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/)\n- [Bianca Aguilar's digital garden](https://garden.bianca.digital/)\n- [Joel Hooks' digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)\n- More in [showcased digital gardens on Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/)\n\nIf you want to start your own digital garden, and are already using Obsidian (or have Markdown files ready to go) you should check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).","lastmodified":"2022-08-21T19:01:42.227213874Z","tags":null},"/notes/How-to":{"title":"How to","content":"# How to read\n\n**Nonfiction:** Learn to skim, connect what you're reading with what you already know, ask questions, make notes of what you will actually want to come back to. (I basically make cheat sheets of lists and processes.

Read in bed for fabulous sleep. Only read books that nourish your soul.\n\n- [How to Read a Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567610.How_to_Read_a_Book)\n\t- One of my all-time fave books - I should buy a copy\n- [The three kinds of non-fiction books](https://commoncog.com/the-3-kinds-of-non-fiction-book/)\n\n# How to learn\n\nWrite down unfamiliar concepts.

Get off social media, unless it's nourishing. Explore intentionally.

Once AI (artificial intelligence) actors reach similar intelligence, and beyond, they will be very powerful. There is currently no guarantee that these AGIs (artificial general intelligence) will be *aligned with human values* - in fact [there is evidence to the contrary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uK7NhdSKprQKZnRjU58X7NLA1auXlWHt/view).\n\n**This is a weird problem, and it is hard to solve.** Most current research is focused either on an engineering-focused approach or a philosophy-focused approach, and [this might not be sufficient](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/more-is-different-for-ai/). AIs seem to develop capabilities in an [unpredictable manner](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/future-ml-systems-will-be-qualitatively-different/), and we need [novel ways of thinking](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/thought-experiments-provide-a-third-anchor/) to progress in this strange field.\n\n**Predicting the progress of developing AGI is also hard.** After all, we are trying to study the development of something that has never been seen before, and we're not sure if we can understand exactly how it will work when it's done.
