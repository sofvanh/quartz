{"/":{"title":"Sofia's Digital Garden","content":"\nHello beautiful, and welcome to my [[notes/Digital gardens|digital garden]].\nIt's not quite a regular website, not quite a blog - it's my personal digital plot of land that I aim to cultivate to make wonderful things bloom and to let others enjoy the products of my mind and life.\n\nThis garden is a very early work in progress.\nIt will be populated as I make notes on new things and as I turn old notes into ones fit for the public.\nRecently I've been writing about [[notes/Inadequacy|the feeling of inadequacy]] and learning [[notes/Why aligning AI matters|why 'aligning' artificial intelligence matters]].","lastmodified":"2022-08-14T14:47:15.403079872Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digital-gardens":{"title":"Digital gardens","content":"\nI recently came across a bunch of websites doing something interesting: \nPeople are sharing their personal notes (often Obsidian vaults), or a curated collection of them, publicly on the internet, on their own websites.\nSome describe these websites as \"digital gardens\". \nThere's a few ways this metaphor can work:\n\n- Thoughts (=seeds) can blossom into fully-fledged ideas (=fruit) when they are nurtured in the form of writing, sharing, and discussing\n- Traversing through a network of someone's personal notes can feel just as intimate and inspiring as exploring the garden that's carefully and lovingly tended by a unique and creative gardener\n- When many different people come together, the result is a kind of community garden, where everyone contributes according to their unique strengths and interests, one's ideas inspire the process of another's, things are discussed out in the open, and everyone gets to enjoy the benefits\n\nI've been having a wonderful time enjoying the notes of people: \nI'm learning about concepts and ideas that I've never before come across, and I'm finding incredibly specific and useful guides to all sorts of problems. \nFurther, as someone who's long been obsessed with gaining perspectives, exploring someone's digital garden feels so much like actually stepping into their brain that to me it's almost addictive.\n\n### My approach\n\nI've long been planning to start a blog, yet the idea is more intimidating than the idea of starting a digital garden. \nThe issue has something to do with how a blog is about showing off finished work, about proving something, while a digital garden is all about sharing the work-in-progress and learning in public - it's about giving, sharing, and nurturing, it's much more personal and private and accepting of mistakes and growth, while something like a blog or social media is more about showing, proving, gaining.\n\nIt seems like the future of the internet is in the direction of collaborative thinking and authentic sharing (or at least that's my dream) and I believe more people should start sharing their personal notes on things they have unique insight and knowledge on.\n\nI'm happy to be exploring this option for self-expression in a way that will help me:\n- Become a better writer\n- Share my thoughts, ideas, learnings, art, and perspective with the world\n- Connect with people who share my interests and want to collaborate in creating a wonderful future\n\n### Resources\n\nList of the inspiring digital gardens I've found so far, in no particular order:\n- [Nicole van der Hoeven's public notes](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain)\n- [Maggie Appleton's tweeted list](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880)\n- [Jacky Zhao's website](https://jzhao.xyz)\n- [Chloe Abrasada's digital garden](https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/)\n- [Bianca Aguilar's digital garden](https://garden.bianca.digital/)\n- [Joel Hooks' digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)\n- More in [showcased digital gardens on Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/)\n\nIf you want to start your own digital garden, and are already using Obsidian (or have Markdown files ready to go) you should check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).","lastmodified":"2022-08-14T14:47:15.403079872Z","tags":null},"/notes/How-to-help-with-aligning-AI":{"title":"How to help with aligning AI","content":"\n- [Nonlinear's list of resources](https://www.nonlinear.org/resources.html)\n- [How to pursue a career in technical AI alignment by Charlie Rogers-Smith](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/iyKnennBbCvaWuKef/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment)\n- [AI safety ideas](https://aisafetyideas.com/)\n\nTo learn more about [[notes/Why aligning AI matters|why AI alignment matters]], check out the [AGI Safety Fundamentals](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals) course by EA Cambridge.","lastmodified":"2022-08-14T14:47:15.403079872Z","tags":null},"/notes/Inadequacy":{"title":"Inadequacy","content":"\n\"I am completely inept and inadequate at all the things I'm trying to do.\"\n\nThat's a thought I had a few days ago.\n\nPeople call me a perfectionist, and I tend to shrug it off.\nI don't really see it.\nI don't feel it.\nI suppose that's because \"perfectionism\" is not a feeling.\nInadequacy is, though.\n\nI spend most of my time feeling pretty good about myself.\nI've worked a lot on my self-image, and I rather like this body-mind that I get to prance around as.\nWhenever I do get hit by a crippling sense of inadequacy, it tends to shake me up quite a bit.\nI suppose sometimes it can be a useful signal, but let's be real, most of the time it's bullshit.\n\nThe voice in your head saying you're not good enough is redundant and irrational and impossible to make quiet by force.\nIt's also so completely dualistic, and therefore opposite to my spiritual path, that I end up feeling bad and a little confused about how this voice still manages to hold such a strong position in my head.\nI know I am good enough, I know we are all good enough, I know comparison of this kind is redundant.\n\nI don't often feel inadequate, but when I do, it's easy for me to go down into a downward spiral.\nI feel inadequate about feeling inadequate.\nFurther, thanks to confirmation bias, in this state I tend to notice subtle \"evidence\" of my inadequacy, making the situation worse.\n\nI could write about how the solution to this feeling could be human connection.\nIn a way it's true - realizing that other people feel inadequate just like you do can be helpful.\nYet I don't think that's the right way.\nYou see, I don't want to solve the feeling after it arises - I want to not feel it in the first place.\nI want to identify the root of my feeling of inadequacy, analyze it, and nurture it back to health. \nI will find the wound that is bleeding out this emotion and help it heal. ðŸ’›","lastmodified":"2022-08-14T14:47:15.403079872Z","tags":null},"/notes/Why-aligning-AI-matters":{"title":"Why 'aligning' AI matters","content":"\n**[Humans are smart, machines could be even smarter, super-smart machines means big changes, and those changes might not be good.](https://intelligence.org/2015/07/24/four-background-claims/)** Humans have *general intelligence*, which means we are able to solve problems in many different contexts. Once AI (artificial intelligence) actors reach similar intelligence, and beyond, they will be very powerful. There is currently no guarantee that these AGIs (artificial general intelligence) will be *aligned with human values* - in fact [there is evidence to the contrary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uK7NhdSKprQKZnRjU58X7NLA1auXlWHt/view).\n\n**This is a weird problem, and it is hard to solve.** Most current research is focused either on an engineering-focused approach or a philosophy-focused approach, and [this might not be sufficient](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/more-is-different-for-ai/). AIs seem to develop capabilities in an [unpredictable manner](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/future-ml-systems-will-be-qualitatively-different/), and we need [novel ways of thinking](https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/thought-experiments-provide-a-third-anchor/) to progress in this strange field.\n\n**Predicting the progress of developing AGI is also hard.** After all, we are trying to study the development of something that has never been seen before, and we're not sure if we can understand exactly how it will work when it's done. We can use different kinds of \"anchors\" as helpers when trying to form a view of how the field of AI will progress. [Taking anchors from evolution and biology](https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-the-biological-anchors-method-in-a-nutshell/) is a popular schema.\n\n**This is a big thing, AGI will impact everything, and it will probably arrive during this century.** This means we might be living in [\"the most important century\"](https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/#Summary), the pivotal point in time where the future of humanity is decided.\n\n### Notes on these notes\n**This page is a work-in-progress.** I'm writing these notes while reading through the first few weeks of [AGI Safety Fundamentals by EA Cambridge](https://www.eacambridge.org/agi-safety-fundamentals), specifically the technical alignment curriculum. I'm trying to clarify my understanding of the problem and the field by putting all the core readings into their place in a prosaic explanation of the topic.\n\n## Further action\nSee [[notes/How to help with aligning AI|How to help with aligning AI]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-14T14:47:15.403079872Z","tags":null}}
