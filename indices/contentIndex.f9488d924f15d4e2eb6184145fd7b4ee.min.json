Early version of an essay.*\n\nMy time is split between hard sciences and art of all kinds.\nI'm a computer science major, software engineer, tech lead, whatever - and in my spare time I sing, play multiple instruments, draw and paint and do calligraphy, act in improv groups and musicals, dance in blues and fusion parties, write prose and poetry, and design knits and interiors.\nIn the past, I've done pottery, digital art, and ballet, to name a few.\n\nOne of my life goals, besides spreading love and having massive positive impact through my career, is to create art.\nSo far I'd say I'm on track!\n\nPeople are often surprised to hear that I'm skilled in all these activities (by the loosest possible definition of \"skilled.\")\nSometimes I get asked how one should start learning one of these skills - playing the piano, for example.\nI've been trying to come up with an answer to this question for some time, and here's my current proposal: **Just start playing around with the medium.**\n\nThat's how I started with my first artistic hobby: Apparently, I began singing before I started talking.\nI've heard stories of how my mother would push me in a stroller down the street and I would be \"singing\" loudly, for all the world to hear.\nWhile I can't personally confirm this story, I do remember learning to play the piano in this way: I was five years old when, during a family trip, I came across a piano and just started pressing the keys.\nApparently that, and my following excitement over the instrument, convinced my parents to buy a piano.\n\nI remember spending endless hours experimenting, coming up with tunes, and especially copying things I'd heard on the radio.\nI had some formal training so I learned my theory, but I almost never did my homework, and I would get tired of every teacher within a year.\nTherefore most of my \"practice\" came not from guidance but from independent experimentation.\n(The only teachers I never tired of were the two teaching me the trumpet and the harp.\nMiia and Pauliina, thank you for never losing your cool after I'd skipped homework!)\n\nAs I've gotten interested in other mediums, I've tried different approaches.\nMany times I've looked for books or online courses to get me \"properly good\" at something.\nWhat I've found is that if I can finish the program in one night, I'll get it done; Otherwise I'll lose motivation and momentum, feel bad, and give up on the medium completely for some time.\n(I had this happen several times with drawing.\nI find programs like [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com) completely antithetical to how one should learn art.)\n\nYou can see this go even worse with music, particularly with children who learn primarily with a teacher.\nI have plenty of friends who learned to play technically impressive pieces as children, and now as adults, they despise the very instrument they spent all that time and effort on.\nThe skill is now giving them zero benefits, and they might even be left with mild trauma.\n\nLearning of art, when it's programmed, is **not fun**.\nAnd when you're not having fun, you're both worse at learning and less creative.\n\nWhat has worked for me is to just **do what I enjoy.**\nFor example, when I'm inspired to become better on the piano, I will do whatever I feel like: I might improvise in my old style, or I might try to learn one of Chopin's Nocturnes from sheet music, or I might even google \"basic jazz chords on piano\" and try to make nice sounds with that new knowledge.\nThe point is that I only do it as long as I'm enjoying myself (I have yet to learn a full Nocturne) and I don't feel bad about going to do something else once I've had my fill of playing.\n\nI use the same approach with all my other artistic endeavors, and the results have been wonderful:\nSince ditching structured programs, I have been learning new mediums faster than ever before, while enjoying myself 100% of the time.\nDiscipline is not the only way to learn to create art.\nIn my opinion, the more you lean on joy and inspiration over discipline, the better off you will be.\n\n*(But that's just me. If you have thoughts on this topic, I'd love to hear them!)*\n\n---\n\n#### Notes\n- (Does this whole write-up come off as self-indulgent?)\n- Things I'd like to add\n\t- Empirical proof on \"generalists\" with no formal training being better musicians (my friend Aleksi, and that guy mentioned in Range (the book))\n\t- More thoughts on how to learn the \"technical skills\" of a medium\n\t\t- There is probably a difference between musical instruments vs visual art vs dance\n\t\t\t- Learning ballet without a course seems very hard; Learning to draw, or sing, with minor instruction in technique, seems totally doable\n\t\t- I guess one benefits quite a lot from single lessons in a medium when first starting\n\t\t\t- This is how I learned calligraphy\n\t- Consider a new note on the pros and cons of learning music theory\n\t- I'd like to link to things I've created, to serve as proof that I actually have developed skills, but also to serve as inspiration","lastmodified":"2022-08-25T14:04:28.32225438Z","tags":null},"/notes/Digital-gardens":{"title":"Digital gardens","content":"\nI recently came across a bunch of websites doing something interesting: \nPeople are sharing their personal notes (often Obsidian vaults), or a curated collection of them, publicly on the internet, on their own websites.\nSome describe these websites as \"digital gardens\". \nThere's a few ways this metaphor can work:\n\n- Thoughts (=seeds) can blossom into fully-fledged ideas (=fruit) when they are nurtured in the form of writing, sharing, and discussing\n- Traversing through a network of someone's personal notes can feel just as intimate and inspiring as exploring the garden that's carefully and lovingly tended by a unique and creative gardener\n- When many different people come together, the result is a kind of community garden, where everyone contributes according to their unique strengths and interests, one's ideas inspire the process of another's, things are discussed out in the open, and everyone gets to enjoy the benefits\n\nI've been having a wonderful time enjoying the notes of people: \nI'm learning about concepts and ideas that I've never before come across, and I'm finding incredibly specific and useful guides to all sorts of problems. \nFurther, as someone who's long been obsessed with gaining perspectives, exploring someone's digital garden feels so much like actually stepping into their brain that to me it's almost addictive.\n\n### My approach\n\nI've long been planning to start a blog, yet the idea is more intimidating than the idea of starting a digital garden. \nThe issue has something to do with how a blog is about showing off finished work, about proving something, while a digital garden is all about sharing the work-in-progress and learning in public - it's about giving, sharing, and nurturing, it's much more personal and private and accepting of mistakes and growth, while something like a blog or social media is more about showing, proving, gaining.\n\nIt seems like the future of the internet is in the direction of collaborative thinking and authentic sharing (or at least that's my dream) and I believe more people should start sharing their personal notes on things they have unique insight and knowledge on.\n\nI'm happy to be exploring this option for self-expression in a way that will help me:\n- Become a better writer\n- Share my thoughts, ideas, learnings, art, and perspective with the world\n- Connect with people who share my interests and want to collaborate in creating a wonderful future\n\n### Resources\n\nList of the inspiring digital gardens I've found so far, in no particular order:\n- [Nicole van der Hoeven's public notes](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain)\n- [Maggie Appleton's tweeted list](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880)\n- [Jacky Zhao's website](https://jzhao.xyz)\n- [Chloe Abrasada's digital garden](https://garden.chloeabrasada.online/)\n- [Bianca Aguilar's digital garden](https://garden.bianca.digital/)\n- [Joel Hooks' digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)\n- More in [showcased digital gardens on Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/showcase/)\n\nOther blogs I like:\n- [Autotranslucence](https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/)\n\nIf you want to start your own digital garden, and are already using Obsidian (or have Markdown files ready to go) you should check out [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).","lastmodified":"2022-08-25T14:04:28.32225438Z","tags":null},"/notes/How-to-be-online":{"title":"How to be online","content":"*ðŸŒ± Seed.

Work-in-progress note where I try to get closer to my goal of experiencing writing and note-taking as part of my spiritual practice.*\n\n**Warning: Very rambly.**\n\nMy goal is for my entire life to be based on spirituality, and for each moment to be a reflection of that. I tend to spend a lot of time writing, and so it makes sense to be deliberate about turning the act of writing into something spiritual.\n\n- Can I write for other people, or for my public notes, and have it be spiritual? How much can I allow other people to pervade my practice? Or should I make engaging with people, as with the universe as a whole, a part of my practice? (The answer is probably yes. What will that look like?)\n- When I write on paper, in Finnish, in the middle of the night under candlelight about my feelings and hopes and dreams, that clearly feels spiritual. I'm tapping into my subconscious, I'm engaging with the powers that are bigger than my conscious mind, and I'm doing work for the betterment of this body-mind that will end up radiating health and love to the universe.\n\t- How can I have this same effect when writing on the computer? Or when writing notes while studying?\n- It seems that when writing is not authenthic, it cannot be spiritual. How authenthic can my public notes become? At what point will I cross the line of over-sharing?\n\t- There's a clear energy towards self-censorship when I know I'm writing something I would like to publish. Can this process be spiritual?\n\t\t- This seems interesting to explore. What is self-censorship? Does it arise out of fear or sensible social dynamics? Does it serve a purpose in digital gardening, when the whole point is that you can make your garden look like you?\n\t\t\t- What am I actually comfortable sharing with the world? Can bad things happen to me if *literally anyone* can read my thoughts?\n\nI'm generally uncomfortable with sharing things in public. I barely exist on social media, and I even avoid big discussion channels when I can. It's clearly easier to be spiritual when you're not connected to society, but completely disconnecting from society is orthogonal to my spiritual goals.\n\nI guess there should be some kind of compromise or gentle landing that I can perform into the wilderness of the internet. Or maybe I just need to be mindful of it. Or maybe I need to recruit my friends to proofread my thoughts for a bit, to make sure I don't accidentally \"do something bad\" - but I don't want to do that! I don't want oversight. I just want to do my thing. The problem is, I don't know how *safe* it is to do my thing like this, in public.\n\nI just can't shake the feeling that it's *so weird* to write something, and then put it online. Once it's out there, it's out there - people are going to make their own interpretations of that writing, and of me, too. Suddenly the text has its own life, it's no longer just mine.\n\nMaybe this is just me learning to have more flexible boundaries. Or, maybe I'm learning to be more generous with my thinking? I'm used to having my world and thoughts all for myself, and I've gotten comfortable in \"owning\" all of it. Perhaps I've come to identify with it even.\n\nIs my thinking no longer mine if I put it online? Once other people make their interpretations, does that stain the purity of my thoughts? Does the experience of the collective override the individual experience?\n\nLet's take a tantric, non-dual view. Let's assume that the individual is the collective; That is, the boundary between \"I\" and \"them\" is illusory. Let's assume \"spirituality\" is actually just the act of engaging with what is, with the divine existence.\n\nFrom this perspective, the act of publishing thought online is simply an act of sharing divine self-expression with the larger divine. It's an act of increasing abundance, an act of generosity, connection, engaging, authenthicity. Any bad that could come out of it would only be a symptom of pain, and as long as the writing comes from a place of health and authenthicity, the writing has much larger potential to heal than it does to harm.\n\nIf we take this stance, then it actually becomes my *duty* to publish online. Not doing so would be selfish.\n\nOk, I think I like that framing. **Sharing my writing online is a divine act of self-expression and generosity, and it is likely to lead to abundance and healing over anything else.**\n\nWe'll see if it sticks.\n\n*(If you're also interested in this topic, please reach out, I would love to talk.)*","lastmodified":"2022-08-25T14:04:28.326254404Z","tags":null},"/notes/How-to-read":{"title":"How to read","content":"*ðŸŒ± Seed.
